# Sample for authentication using the Code Flow

The Authorization Code is an OAuth 2.0 grant that regular web apps use in order to access an API.

More on this flow: <https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/learn/oauth-authorization-code-grant>

This version uses cURL for the requests. If your installation doesn't support cURL, there is an example using the legacy file_get_contents() as well.

The [JavaScript sample repository](https://saxobank.github.io/openapi-samples-js/authentication/oauth2-code-flow/) contains a sample where PHP is used as backend, and JavaScript handles the requests. 

A good tutorial on this grant type: <https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant>
