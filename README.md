# OpenAPI PHP Sample Repository

This repository contains sample files demonstrating OpenAPI interactions in PHP.

Since this is only backend, we recommend to take a look at the more detailed (and also web based) samples of the [JavaScript repository](https://saxobank.github.io/openapi-samples-js/).

## Requirements

Samples run against Saxo's simulation environment and require an **access token** in order to function. Saxo provides 24-hour tokens on the [Developer Portal](https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/token/), which is the easiest way to get started. An account is required to generate a token, which can be created for free.
